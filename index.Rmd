# **Biography**

I am a PhD candidate in Applied Statistics at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). Prior to arriving at UCR, I earned a MS in Statistics at Ball State University, and a BS in Statistics at the University of California, Davis. I have worked on a variety of projects related to time series, biostatistics, sports analysis, fiscal policy, and spectral analysis. 
<br>
<br>
When I am not working I like to participate in endurance sports, or go rock climbing.  I enjoy sewing dresses for my niece, and love a good book when I have down time.  I have two pets, a dog and a cat.  Some might also consider them statisticians considering how often they like to help me work.
<br>
<br>
Some selected projects and course materials may be found under "Projects" and "Teaching", respectively.  Please feel free to contact me for collaboration, mentoring, or consulting work.
