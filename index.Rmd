# **Biography**

I am a PhD candidate in Applied Statistics at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). Prior to arriving at UCR, I earned a masters of science in statistics at Ball State University, and a bachelors of science in statistics with an emphasis in economics at the University of California, Davis. I have worked on a variety of projects related to time series, biostatistics, sports analysis, fiscal policy, and spectral analysis. 
<br>
<br>
When I am not working I like to participate in endurance sports and go rock climbing.  I enjoy sewing dresses for my niece, and love a good book when I have down time.  I have two pets, a dog named Darwin and a cat name June Carter.  Some might also consider them statisticians considering how often they like to help me work.
<br>
<br>
Selected projects and course materials may be found under "Consulting" and "Teaching", respectively.  If you are interested in collaboration, mentoring, or consulting work please send me an email.
