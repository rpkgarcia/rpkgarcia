# **Biography**

I currently an assistant professor at [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/) with joint appointment in the Mathematics department, and the Statistics & Data Science department. I obtained my PhD at the University of California Riverside, where my dissertation advisor was [Dr. James Flegal](https://james-flegal.github.io/). Prior to arriving at UCR, I earned a masters of science in statistics at Ball State University, where my thesis advisor was [Dr. Rebecca Pierce](https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/math/about/facultyandstaff/faculty/piercerebecca). I also earned a bachelors of science in statistics with an emphasis in economics at the University of California, Davis. I am from Los Angeles county originally. I have worked on a variety of projects related to time series, biostatistics, sports analysis, fiscal policy, and spectral analysis. 
<br>
<br>
When I am not working I like to participate in endurance sports and go rock climbing.  I enjoy sewing dresses for my niece, and love a good book when I have down time.  I currently live in Northampton MA with my partner and my dog.
